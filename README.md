# SHAPWorkshopDevCon
## Overview
This project is structured for efficient data science and machine learning workflows. It includes well-organized directories for raw and processed data, notebooks, scripts, models, and outputs.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure


### **ðŸ”¹ Directory Breakdown**
ðŸ“Œ **`data/`** â†’ Stores all datasets for the project.
- **`raw/`** â†’ Unprocessed data as received from the source.
- **`processed/`** â†’ Data that has been cleaned and preprocessed.
- **`metadata/`** â†’ Configuration files, data dictionaries, or metadata about datasets.

ðŸ“Œ **`notebooks/`** â†’ Jupyter notebooks for analysis, data exploration, and experimentation.

ðŸ“Œ **`scripts/`** â†’ Python scripts for automation, data preprocessing, and model training.

ðŸ“Œ **`src/`** â†’ Source code for the project.
- **`utils/`** â†’ Helper functions such as logging, preprocessing utilities, and feature engineering.

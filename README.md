3. If you are a new user, you will be prompted to request access to CUAHSI JupyterHub.
	- In the comment box, type: **"Clara, I am a SHAP Workshop participant"**. Clara from CUAHSI will be facilitating our workshop and will grant you access. If you are not participating in the workshop, this process typically 		  takes one business day.

##  **Setting up your Conda environment**

### **Opening the Terminal from within JupyterHub**
Once the Hydroshare resource has been opened within CUAHSI JupyterHub, open the terminal from the launcher.

### Locating the **`environment.yml` file**
Copy the path of the **`environment.yml`** file in the project directory.

### Creating and activating the new Conda environment
Open the terminal and run the command **`conda env create -f <insert path to environment.yml>`** in the terminal. This will create a conda environment called **`shap_vals`** and download the dependencies stored in the **`environment.yml`** file. Activate this environment by running **`conda activate shap_vals`** in the terminal.

### Installing Jupyter kernel from new Conda environment 
To install a Jupyter kernel from this environment to run the shap_workshop Jupyter notebook, run the following command: **`python -m ipykernel install --user --name shap_workshop_env`**. This will create a kernel called **`shap_workshop_env`** which was installed from the **`shap_vals`** Conda environment. 

### Selecting the kernel for the Jupyter notebook
To configure the kernel, open the shap_workshop Jupyter notebook and select the **`shap_workshop_env`** kernel that was just installed.

## Overview
Welcome to the SHapley Additive Explanations workshop at the 2025 CIROH Dev Con conference! 

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### **ðŸ”¹ Directory Breakdown**
ðŸ“Œ **`notebooks/`** â†’ Jupyter notebooks for training models. The main workshop notebook is located in the main project directory.

ðŸ“Œ **`models/`** â†’ Pretrained machine learning models and model checkpoints.

ðŸ“Œ **`outputs/`** â†’ Stores generated SHAP values for the LSTM model.

ðŸ“Œ **`src/`** â†’ Contains source code for the project with helper functions for data preprocessing, visualization, model building, etc.

3. If you are a new user, you will be prompted to request access to CUAHSI JupyterHub.
	- In the comment box, type: **"Clara, I am a SHAP Workshop participant"**. Clara from CUAHSI will be facilitating our workshop and will grant you access. If you are not participating in the workshop, this process typically 		  takes one business day.

##  **Setting up your Conda environment**

### **Opening the Terminal from within JupyterHub**
Once the Hydroshare resource has been opened within CUAHSI JupyterHub, open the terminal from the launcher.

### Creating and activating the new Conda environment
Open the terminal and run the command **`conda env create -f <insert path to environment.yml>`** in the terminal. This will create a conda environment called **`shap-workshop`** and download the dependencies stored in the **`environment.yml`** file. Activate this environment by running **`conda activate shap-workshop`** in the terminal.

### Installing Jupyter kernel from new Conda environment 
To install a Jupyter kernel from this environment to run the shap_workshop Jupyter notebook, run the following command: **`python -m ipykernel install --user --name shap_workshop_env`**. This will create a kernel called **`shap_workshop_env`** which was installed from the **`shap-workshop`** Conda environment. 

### Selecting the kernel for the Jupyter notebook
To configure the kernel, open the shap_workshop Jupyter notebook and select the **`shap_workshop_env`** kernel that was just installed.
